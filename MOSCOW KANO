Great! Now that you've created tasks in your backlog (TM-5 to TM-8), let's proceed with the following steps:

---

## ðŸ“Œ *Step 1: Verify Your Backlog Items*

Make sure the tasks have the correct summaries and descriptions:

1. *TM-5*: User Login and Role Assignment  
2. *TM-6*: Task Creation and Assignment  
3. *TM-7*: Task Prioritization and Deadlines  
4. *TM-8*: Progress Tracking and Reporting  

---

## ðŸ“Œ *Step 2: Prioritize the Backlog Using MoSCoW and Kano Models*

### 1. *Add MoSCoW Prioritization*:
   - Open each issue (TM-5 to TM-8).
   - In each issue:
     - Click on the *"Labels"* field or *"More Fields"*.
     - Add one of the following labels for MoSCoW prioritization:
       - *TM-5* â†’ Label: Must-Have  
       - *TM-6* â†’ Label: Must-Have  
       - *TM-7* â†’ Label: Should-Have  
       - *TM-8* â†’ Label: Should-Have  

### 2. *Add Kano Model Categorization*:
   - In each issue:
     - Add another label for Kano categorization:
       - *TM-5* â†’ Label: Basic-Need  
       - *TM-6* â†’ Label: Basic-Need  
       - *TM-7* â†’ Label: Performance-Need  
       - *TM-8* â†’ Label: Performance-Need

## ðŸ“Œ *Step 3: Create a Sprint*

1. *Go to the Backlog View*:
   - Navigate to your projectâ€™s *Backlog*.

2. *Create a New Sprint*:
   - Click on *"Create Sprint"* (usually at the top of the backlog).

3. *Move Backlog Items into the Sprint*:
   - Drag and drop *TM-5, **TM-6, **TM-7, and **TM-8* into the newly created sprint.

4. *Start the Sprint*:
   - Click *"Start Sprint."*
   - Enter the following details:
     - *Sprint Name*: Task Management Sprint 1  
     - *Duration*: 1 Week  
     - *Start Date*: Todayâ€™s date  
     - *End Date*: 7 days from today  
   - Click *"Start"* to begin the sprint.

## ðŸ“Œ *Step 4: Track Progress*

1. *View the Sprint Board*:
   - Go to the *"Active Sprints"* or *"Board"* view.
   - You will see your tasks (TM-5 to TM-8) in the *"To Do"* column.

2. *Update Task Status*:
   - As work progresses, move tasks across the columns:
     - *To Do â†’ In Progress â†’ Done*

---

## ðŸ“Œ *Step 5: Take Screenshots*

1. *Sprint Start Screenshot*:
   - Take a screenshot of the sprint board showing the tasks in the *"To Do"* column.

2. *Sprint End Screenshot*:
   - Once all tasks are completed and moved to *"Done"*, take another screenshot of the sprint board.

---

Now you've successfully:

1. Created tasks.
2. Prioritized them using MoSCoW and Kano models.
3. Created and started a sprint.
4. Tracked progress and captured the sprint board at the start and end.
